Since the incorporation of situational awareness training in the 90’s and 00’s, there has been a dramatic decline in aviation accidents, particularly in the United States. In the early days of aviation, these concepts were exclusively used by the military. During the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s it was not uncommon for passenger planes to crash due entirely to human errors in flight operations.
